She was part of the SNSF research project “[Swiss Graphic Design and Typography Revisited](https://sgdtr.ch/)” (2016–2020), conducting research on the history of graphic design education in Switzerland. In 2021 she co-edited the book "[Swiss Graphic Design Histories: Visual Arguments](https://www.scheidegger-spiess.ch/produkt/swiss-graphic-design-histories/1011)" (Scheidegger&Spiess).
