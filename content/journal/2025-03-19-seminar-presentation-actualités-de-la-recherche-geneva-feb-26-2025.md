On 26 February 2025, Clémence Imbert presented the WYSIWYG project at the Actualités de la Recherche seminar, co-organised by Anthony Masure (HEAD - Geneva) and Giovanna Zapperi (UNIGE). In her presentation, Clémence Imbert went back over the origins of the WYSIWYG concept, pointing out that it is more a marketing promise than a technical reality. Between the mid-1980s and the 1990s, desktop publishing was the scene of fierce commercial competition. As a counterpoint to journalistic sources and the editorial content of the specialist press, it therefore seems appropriate to attach particular importance to the study of advertisements, for what they say about these technologies and their target users. In the discussion that followed the presentation, students and colleagues expressed their curiosity about alternative uses for graphic design software, or their use in contexts of struggle, on the fringes of the traditional publishing industry. We hope to satisfy their curiosity in the years to come!
