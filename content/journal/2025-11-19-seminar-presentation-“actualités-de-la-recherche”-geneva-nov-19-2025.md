On November 19, 2025, Léonore Conte and Caroll Maréchal presented part of the research conducted for the WYSIWYG project as part of the *Actualités de la Recherche* seminar, co-organized by Anthony Masure (HEAD – Geneva) and Giovanna Zapperi (University of Geneva).

In their presentation, drawing on concrete case studies, they addressed the methodological challenges and key issues raised by the research axis “A Profession in Transition,” including the emergence of a terminology specific to new computing practices, the expansion of graphic designers’ fields of activity, and the transformation of the production chain.
