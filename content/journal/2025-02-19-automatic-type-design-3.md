On September 19, 2025, researchers Clémence Imbert and Julie Blanc presented an initial overview of the project at [Automatic Design Type 3](https://automatic-type-design.anrt-nancy.fr/colloques/automatic-type-design-3) at ANRT (Atelier National de Recherche Typographique) in Nancy, France.

The talk was a general presentation of the project, with a particular focus on the legacy of the WYSIWYG paradigm (common to both type design and graphic design software) and a reflection upon its relevance in contemporary and future web-publishing practices.

The Web fundamentally challenges the notion of WYSIWYG, requiring graphic design to adapt to display windows of unknown sizes and devices with unpredictable characteristics. The use of web languages (and therefore code) to address this diversity of displays by programming stylistic rules redistributes the skills of graphic designers and gives rise to new practices. At the same time, the context of multi-format publishing introduces new practices in print design, where web technologies are employed to program printed layouts, challenging the notion of WYSIWYG.
