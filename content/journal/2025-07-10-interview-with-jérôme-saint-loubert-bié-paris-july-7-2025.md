Jérôme Saint-Loubert Bié (born 1970) is a French artist and graphic designer. He developed an early interest in personal computers and, as a teenager, first began working with an Apple II at his family home. From 1984 onward, he kept up with emerging trends, notably by attending Apple Expo. In the early 1990s, he worked with graphic designer Susanna Shannon, who was then equipped with a Mac II. Between 1993 and 1996, he studied at CalArts in California, United States, an institution with a computer lab equipped with around twenty Macs. Serving as a lab monitor for one year, he took advantage of this position to experiment with computer-based layout and 3D graphics.
