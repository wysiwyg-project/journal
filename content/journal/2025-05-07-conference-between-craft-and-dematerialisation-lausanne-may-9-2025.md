On May 9, 2025, Clémence Imbert gave a lecture on the WYSIWYG project as part of the conference ‘Between craft and dematerialisation : the dynamics of the graphic design profession’, organised by the Musée Historique de Lausanne in conjunction with the exhibition ‘Signé Jeker’ (10.04 - 28.09.2025).

This study day brought together Werner Jeker, Priscilla Balmer & Yvo Hählen, Demian Conrad, Davide Fornari, Ian Party, Sophie Rubin et François Vallotton and students from ERACOM, ECAL and HEAD - Geneva. 

Entitled ‘WYSIWYG: Un rêve, des réalités’, the conference focused on the digital turn, the background of Werner Jeker's career. In particular, it described how WYSIWYG technologies have transformed the work processes of visual communication professionals, from then on freed from a number of tedious operations: calculations, various manipulations of text and images ; while at the same time renewing creative and formal perspectives. Behind this promise, the adoption of the computer was not at all an obvious and easy choice. WYSIWYG research project questions, in particular, the heroic narrative of the digital turn, by describing, alongside the flamboyant projects of early enthusiasts, the reality of the anonymous work of press and publishing layout designers, who were the first to be affected by the computerization of the graphics chain. The study of trade journals from the 1980s and 1990s show that the adoption of the computer by graphic designers was made possible both by a rapid adaptation of technologies to the needs of graphic designers, and by major marketing and training efforts. These are the realities that need to be examined, to measure the "revolutionary" impact of this digital turn in graphic design.
