On the 25th of March 2025, from 1:15pm to 3:00pm, WYSIWYG Seminar #2 was addressed by Michael Renner. Head of the Institute Digital Communication Environments at the Basel School of Design – FHNW, Michael Renner experienced the digital revolution first-hand working for Apple Computer and The Understanding Business in California, just after completing his education at the Basel School of Design. For this presentation, titled “Between Analogue and Digital: Experience with an Emerging Technology”, Michael Renner mentioned early life experiences that shaped his conception of creation. In a room filled with students of the FHNW HGK Basel, Michael had gathered printed material of several decades, including the portfolio he had brought with him to the United States in the early 1980s. His first job was at Apple Creative Services, where he produced works on the first pre-versions of Illustrator. The work he did at The Understanding Business, the agency of Richard Saul Wurman, on a user-friendly yellow pages for the Pacific Bell Company received specific praise and attention. Part of these phonebooks were produced on Macintosh using DTP tools, leaving designers time for research on the drawings of pictograms. Back in Basel in the early 1990s, Michael Renner continued to develop with students computer-based work  in the framework of his teaching at HGK, including posters and interactive media projects. Some of them have been highlighted in the Fall of 2024 in the exhibition ["Unleashed"](https://www.tinguely.ch/en/exhibitions/exhibitions/2024/unleashed.html) at Museum Tinguely in Basel. Participants could also test a 1984 Macintosh which was kept at HGK for decades and was recently and successfully restarted. Video of this event will soon be made available.
