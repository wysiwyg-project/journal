On September 22, 2025, Caroll Maréchal visited the French National Archives to consult part of the archives of the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs (Ensad).

Ensad established a computer lab as early as 1982 with the support of the Ministry of Culture. While the history of this lab is particularly well known for its involvement in animation and 3D experimentation, archival research will make it possible to better understand its impact on the training of graphic designers, both within and beyond the school, as well as the involvement of the French state, through the Ministry of Culture, in the deployment of computing tools in art schools.
